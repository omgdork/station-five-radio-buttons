# Radio Buttons

Create an interactive and dynamic HTML form using radio buttons using JavaScript*** that will render multiple groups of radio buttons. 

Add a submit button at the bottom that is only enabled when an option from all groups has been selected.

_***You are welcome to solve the problem using vanilla ES5/6/7, TypeScript, React, Vue or Angular. Feel free to use your own tools or libraries that you like._

They should be dynamically rendered based on the following data structure:

```javascript
[
  // first group of radio-buttons
  [
    { id: '101', value: 'Vegetarian' },
    { id: '102', value: 'Nut allergy' },
    { id: '103', value: 'Halal' }
  ],
  // second group of radio-buttons
  [
    { id: '201', value: 'Cashew chicken' },
    { id: '202', value: 'Sweet and sour pork' },
    { id: '203', value: 'Stir fried Tofu' },
    { id: '204', value: 'Vegetable fried rice' },
    { id: '205', value: 'Pad Thai' },
    { id: '206', value: 'Massaman beef' },
  ],
  // third group of radio-buttons
  [
    { id: '301', value: 'Peanut sauce' },
    { id: '302', value: 'Oyster sauce' },
    { id: '303', value: 'Vegetable spring rolls' },
    { id: '304', value: 'Steamed rice' },
  ],
]
```

Initially, only items from the first group are able to be selected. Inputs in second and third groups are to be initially disabled.

When an item from the first group is selected, valid items from the second group are enabled. Valid items are specified in a set of rules; which is an object where the key is the ID of an option, and the value is an array containing the IDs of options which are NOT compatible. Items in the third group remain disabled until an item in the second group is selected.

```javascript
{
  // 'Vegetarian' is NOT compatible with 'Cashew chicken', 'Sweet and sour pork', 'Massaman beef', 'Oyster sauce'
  101: [201, 202, 206, 302], 
  // 'Nut allergy' is NOT compatible with 'Cashew chicken', 'Peanut sauce',
  102: [201, 301], 
  // 'Halal' is NOT compatible with 'Sweet and sour pork',
  103: [202], 
  // 'Vegetable fried rice' is NOT compatible with 'Steamed rice' (you don't need more rice... carb overload),
  204: [304],
  // 'Pad thai' is NOT compatible with 'Steamed rice' (Pad thai comes with noodles),
  205: [304],
}
```
  
## Evaluation
Feel free to ask your tester all the questions you need to ask if need be, or if you need any clarification on the requirements.

When complete, create a private repository in Bitbucket and invite these users to access your repo `stn5-shass` `rpangilinan-s5` `alexkreuz`.

We will evaluate your response based on the following criteria:

* Architectural approach / programming paradigms used. We adhere to see a functional / immutable style, while you don't have to follow this, you're welcome to show off these skills if you are familiar with them.
* Consistency in style, readability, naming conventions.
* Code should be easy to read and understand, with little to no comments required.
* Reduce code duplication; prefer use of abstracting functionality.
* Showing understanding of scope / binding / this (where required in your solution).
* Problem solving and design approach.
